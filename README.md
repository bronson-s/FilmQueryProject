### Film Query Project
## Week 7


### Overview
For this project students got practice using SQL through a Java Database Connectivity model. Additionally this project required students to use a DAO to achieve Object Relational Mapping.

### Concepts
* JDBC
* SQL
* MAMP
* ORM
* Formatting queries using predicates and functions
* INNER and OUTER JOINS


### Lessons Learned
This project gave me confidence in forming my queries in SQL. I also gained a good understanding of how Java and SQL can be applied together.  Furthermore I now have a sense of the power that comes with data and data manipulation. Also I started to see how we were possibly making something like this more complicated then it need to be and I cant wait to see what comes next. I also got a good sense of how dangerous it can be to not pay proper attention or place the proper safe guards when working with data. Overall this was one of the most enjoyable projects to date.

#### How to Run
