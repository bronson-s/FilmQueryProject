### Film Query Project
## Week 7


### Overview
For this project students got practice using SQL through a Java Database Connectivity model. Additionally this project required students to use a DAO to achieve Object Relational Mapping.

### Concepts
* JDBC
* SQL
* MAMP
* ORM
* Formatting queries using predicates and functions
* INNER and OUTER JOINS


### Lessons Learned
This project gave me confidence in forming my queries in SQL. I also gained a good understanding of how Java and SQL can be applied together. As it turned out the most challenging part of this project was figuring out how to use an outer join as we only have briefly discussed them at this point and are schedule to properly address them this coming week. However, getting the outer join to work the way I wanted it to greatly simplified the project. Furthermore I now have a sense of the power that comes with data and data manipulation. I also got a good sense of how dangerous it can be to not pay proper attention or place the proper safe guards when working with data. Overall this was one of the most enjoyable projects to date.

#### How to Run

1. Run as Java Program within your IDE
